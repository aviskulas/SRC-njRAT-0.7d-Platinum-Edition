### Common compile errors:  

#### If you edit certain forms you will sometimes run into errors:  
  
Type 'NJRAT.L1' is not defined  
Type 'NJRAT.Pp1' is not defined  
Type 'NJRAT.Gclass9' is not defined  
  
#### These will happen during compiling, to fix them, follow this:

Change
```
Me.L1 = New NJRAT.L1()
  
Me.Pp1 = New NJRAT.Pp1()
```
To
```
Me.L1 = New L1()
  
Me.Pp1 = New Pp1()
```
  
After this, compile again and it should be fixed.
