###### Currently working on: CMSTP Bypass. (Just debugging it since it fails sometimes.)
###### Feel free to suggest anything in the issues tab.

### Latest Updates:  
* Make the keylogger removable/toggled due to behavior detection with AVs.
* Remove unused comments within the stub.  
* Clean and fix up some forms.  
* Update .NET Reactor to a later version and compressed it.  
* Add an image to the notification window.  
* New option to invoke a BSOD from usermode using ntraiseharderror.  
* Sort out the mostly unusued options and put them into the Persistence category. (USB Spreader & Botkiller)  
* Make the lock screen hard to escape by minimizing any application that tries to get over it.  
* Fix the pastebin DNS crashing, instead it will continue retrying.  
* 4 new better and higher quality GDI+ effects:  
* Draw a full rainbow gradient to the victims  screen.  
* Draw a spooky face to a random position on the victims  screen.  
* Draw some crazy lines all over the victims screen.  
* Draw System Icons all over the victims screen.  
 
### TODO:
###### (I've been stuck on adding UAC bypass methods for now, but i'll be working on it.)
* Add more UAC Bypass methods (fodhelper, cmstp)
* Feel free to suggest improvements/features in Issues tab.  
* Make the MBR code optionally removable due to the "KillMBR" detection with AVs.

### Common compile errors:  

#### If you edit certain forms you will sometimes run into errors:  
  
Type 'NJRAT.L1' is not defined  
Type 'NJRAT.Pp1' is not defined  
Type 'NJRAT.Gclass9' is not defined  
  
#### These will happen during compiling, to fix them, follow this:

Change
```
Me.L1 = New NJRAT.L1()
  
Me.Pp1 = New NJRAT.Pp1()
```
To
```
Me.L1 = New L1()
  
Me.Pp1 = New Pp1()
```
  
After this, compile again and it should be fixed.
